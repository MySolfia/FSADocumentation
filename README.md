# FSADocumentation
This repository contains documentation from the US Department of Education regarding the Federal Student Aid integrations, data formats, reports, and general HOWTOs. The source FSA website is not always available and some of the docs are not available at all for use with agentic AI so we maintain a copy of the publicly available information.
